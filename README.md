# cl0ud
cl0ud is a website and a play on words(like cloud computing)that suggests the presence of the physical infrastructure and technological capabilities underlying the Internet. Volumetric clouds generated by browser-native WebGL and raymarching functions change their speed based on the current bandwidth speed of the device rendering the page.
